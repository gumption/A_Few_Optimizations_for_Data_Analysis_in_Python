I read [Karolina Alexiou](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ariadni-karolina-alexiou/34/657/9a3)'s excellent blog post about [The Top Mistakes Developers Make When Using Python for Big Data Analytics](https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/top-mistakes-python-big-data-analytics) with great interest. I have made - and partially learned from - all of the mistakes she warned about. I was particularly eager to try out and extend some of the code snippets she provided to illustrate 2 of the mistakes:

* Mistake #1: Reinventing the wheel
* Mistake #2: Not tuning for performance

I started composing a rather lengthy comment on the blog post, highlighting some aspects I especially appreciated and seeking clarification on others. Whenever I notice myself getting a bit voluminous in a comment on someone else's blog, I typically compose a separate post on my own blog ([Gumption](http://gumption.typepad.com)), and then substitute a link (with a brief summary) on the original blog post. 

In this instance, it seemed more appropriate - and constructive - to create an IPython Notebook to illustrate and/or investigate some of the issues I was raising in that comment ... and thereby finding some of the clarifications I was initially seeking.

I am sharing those investigations here in case they are of interest or use to others ... and because it's been a while since I created and shared an IPython Notebook about [Python and data science](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gumption/Python_for_Data_Science/blob/master/Python_for_Data_Science_all.ipynb).
